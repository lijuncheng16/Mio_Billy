INSTALL BEFORE BUILDING:

   SleekXMPP library for Python
   (http://github.com/fritzy/SleekXMPP/zipball/develop)

BUILDING:

   NOTE: json-cpp-build.sh assumes that "platform=linux-gcc".
   Script should work unmodified in Linux and OS X.

   $ cd bt_datastore/
   $ ./json-cpp-build.sh
   $ make
   $ cd ../

RUNNING:

   Uncomment third line of start-store.sh and edit with your XMPP login info.

   $ ./start-store.sh

   This starts the store agent and tile server inside the screen utility.
   Browse to 'http://localhost:4720' to view data stored in the store.kvs/ directory.
