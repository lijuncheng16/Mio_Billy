<li>
What is SOX?<br/>
<p>
SOX (Sensor Over XMPP) is an XML based payload specification that allows
sensors and actuators (data producers) to provide information to
agents (data consumers) via
<a href="http://xmpp.org/">XMPP</a>'s
publish-subscribe extension
(<a href="http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.html">XEP-0060</a>).
</p>
</li>
<li>
Why did you create SOX?<br/>
<p>
There are a growing number of Internet connected devices that sense
and actuate physical elements in the environment.
A variety of applications exist that would benefit from sharing
information between these types of devices.
</p>
</li>
<li>
Why use eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol
(<a href="http://xmpp.org/">XMPP</a>)?<br/>
<p>
XMPP provides an easy-to-use, decentralized and secure communication
mechanism that is ideal for supporting these types of sensing and
control applications at scale.
</p>
</li>
<li>
OK, but why use the pubsub extension
(<a href="http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.html">XEP-0060</a>)?<br/>
<p>
The “publish-subscribe” design philosophy is very well suited for
interfacing with sensor and actuator systems for the following reasons.
First, subscription-based data dissemination shelters
resource-constrained devices from external requests.
In many cases, a transducer exists at the leaf-node of a system that
is resource constrained (i.e. a temperature sensor as part of a
BACnet network) and could not practically push or reply to tens or
hundreds of data requests.
Second, presence information as well as push-based asynchronous
distribution of data helps decouple timing requirements between data
producers and consumers.
Devices can easily declare that they are active and then push data to
subscribers at their preferred rate.
Finally, XMPP’s provides decentralized addressing, authentication,
encrypted communication as well as per-node access control for these
devices.
With the addition of a common messaging schema, this provides an ideal
platform for the sharing of sensor data.
</p>
</li>
<li>
So how does it work?<br/>
<p>
In the case of sensing, a transducer (e.g., a temperature sensor,
a power meter) is interfacing with an internet-enabled device
(e.g., a smart phone, a computer) through a software entity
running on this device, that is able to collect measurements
from the transducer, perform some local processing and publish a
value of interest to a pre-specified XMPP event node.
We refer to this piece of software as the adapter.
At the other end of the communication channel, software agents that
are subscribed (and have proper access) to this event node will
receive the pushed message and, given that it is using a common schema,
will be able to parse it and process the data however they choose to.
</p>
</li>
<li>
That's fine for sensors, but what about actuators?<br/>
<p>
For actuation, a similar process is followed. A transducer, in this case
an actuator, is interfacing with an internet-enabled device
running an adapter.
This adapter is able to communicate with both the XMPP server
and the actuator.
An XMPP event node is used to communicate the actuation commands
as well as the state of the actuator.
By default, the adapter will be subscribed to this event node.
When an actuation message is published to the event node,
the adapter will receive the message, parse it,
and issue the appropriate actuation command.
The resulting state of the transducer or controlled element
after this actuation will then be published back to the same event
node by the adapter.
In this way, the software agent that originally issued the actuation
command can receive an acknolwedgement through the same XMPP event node.
</p>
</li>
<li>
Sounds complicated.<br/>
<p>
Not really. Basically SOX is just following the sematics of pubsub and
defining a data format so that publishers and subscribers can
understand one another.
</li>
<li>
Wait, this sounds like device drivers.
Are you creating device drivers for the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things">internet of things</a>?<br/>
<p>
To a large extent, yes. In essence, one can look at the device/adapter model
described here as being analogous to the device/device driver model
used by operating systems.
In the case of an operating system, device drivers work with
physical devices (i.e. keyboards, serial ports, disk drives, etc) as well
as software-only devices (i.e. ramdisks, loopback devices, etc)
to create a common access method (i.e. block and character devices).
In this case, adapters work with devices that have a variety of device
specific access controls, attributes and access methodologies to create
a common access method - specifically the common access method described
<a href="http://sensor.andrew.cmu.edu/xep/sox-xep.html">here</a>.
Continuing this anaolgy, an agent is an entity that interacts with
the information provided by one or more adapters in much the same way
that an application interacts with information provided by one or more
device drivers.
</p>
</li>
<li>
Sounds good in theory, but are there any implementations?<br/>
<p>
Yes.
<a href="http://www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)</a>
is undertaking a project named
<a href="http://www.ices.cmu.edu/censcir/sensor-andrew/">Sensor Andrew</a>
which is a sensor network that will enable the dense instrumentation
of the whole of Carnegie Mellon’s campus as a living laboratory
for real-world infrastructure challenges. 
</p>
</li>
<li>
Cool, but I meant, an implementation I can play with... Where's the code?<br/>
<p>
TODO: can we simplify and put all under the same license?<br>
The code for Sensor Andrew is open source (parts released under
GNU license and parts under the apache license).
There are libraries in both C and java as well as sample
adapters and example code available via svn.
The Sensor Andrew svn checkout string is:
</p>
<p>
svn checkout svn://sensor.andrew.cmu.edu:/srv/svn/repos/sensor-andrew/sox
</p>
</li>
<li>
Any more documentation?<br/>
<p>
TODO: Documentation seems out of date<br/>

</li>
<li>
Does it work with any XMPP server?<br/>
<p>
Since SOX defines a payload format on top of XEP-0060, it works with
any XMPP server
that supports XEP-0060. Two servers that are known to work with SOX include:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ejabberd.im/">ejabberd</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/index.jsp">openfire</a></li>
</ul>
</p>
</li>
<li>
Where can I read the full SOX specification?<br/>
<p>
The SOX specification is available online at:
</p>
<p>

</p>
</li>
<li>
The SOX specification talks about "kelvin" for temperature.
I want to use Fahrenheit because everyone knows what Fahrenheit means.<br/>
<p>
One of the biggest issues with sharing data in science is the need to
use standardized units of measure. Although the United States may be
a bit behind the times on this, most of the rest of the world has moved to
<a href="http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/">SI units</a>
(aka the metric system).
Therefore, to make the exchange of information consistent,
the "on wire" format requires the use of SI units.
All adapters (data producers) are required
to convert from their sensor specific native units (such as Fahrenheit)
to the corresponding
SI unit (such as kelvin) so that agents (data consumers) know what to expect.
It becomes a software nightmare for a data consumer if it needs to deal with
data producers that may provide a distance measurement in feet,
inches, meters, furlongs, fathoms, klafter, faden, etc.
Remember, part of the point for SOX is to make it easier for people to
write both data consumers as well as data producers which means restricting
the list of possible units of measure for the "on wire" format.
</p>
</li>
<li>
If an adapter can handle "open" and
"close", should the adapter be written to expect the string values
"open" and "close"? Or should that be translated into numeric
enumerations (0 and 1)?<br/>
<p>
Either one is fine, whatever works for your environment.
</p>
</li>
<li>
How would an agent know what the enumeration should be? Specifically,
where does the "['open', 'close']" (list of enumerated values) or
"{'open': 0, 'close':1}" (map between enumerated values and names) get
passed from adapter to agent?.
<p>
The spec currently doesn't define a way to do this, but one way that we
have used that works is to
include a<br/>
<br/>
&lt;property name="enum" value="['open', 'close']" /&gt;<br/>
<br/>
to indicate it takes strings or<br/>
<br/>
&lt;property name="enum" value="{'open': 0, 'close':1}" /&gt;<br/>
<br/>
to indicate it takes numbers (which
also defines the mapping of allowed values to numeric values).
And yes, for those familiar with python, this corresponds to a list and
a dict...
</p>
</li>
<li>
My sensor's enumerated data is a bitmap so it is easier to understand
as a hex value. How can numbers be sent as hex?<br/>
<p>
The "on-wire" format for numbers should be decimal. When displaying the
number to humans, feel free to use whatever format is appropriate (decimal,
hex, binary, whatever), but any adapter on the network should be able to
interpret that number as a decimal number.
